# Embedded Magento Extension Documentation

Documentation is time consuming and difficult to manage.  I hate having to update PDFs and circulate them to customers.  Using a wiki is a great idea, but
the instructions might not map directly to a customer's installed version.  How about we ship documentation with our extensions?

Place your documentation in a `docs/` folder inside your extension root, add a couple of directives to your `config.xml` and you're done!

### Installation

If you're a modman user, you can do the following in a Magento directory:

    mkdir .modman/ && cd .modman
    git clone https://github.com/punkstar/magento_bundleddocs.git bundleddocs
    cd ../
    modman deploy bundleddocs

Otherwise, just copy the files over your existing Magento installation.

### Accessing Documentation

The extension adds a menu option under **System** in the Magento administrationa area called **Extension Documentation**.

It'll look something like this:

### Writing Documentation

Your documentation lives inside `YourNamespace/YourModule/docs/`.  Documentation files are plain HTML.

Once you've written your documentation you can get it to appear in the documentation view menu by adding the following to your `config.xml`:

	<config>
		...
	    <docs>
	        <Meanbee_BundledDocs>
	            <title><![CDATA[Meanbee: Bundled Docs Provider]]></title>
	            <pages>
	                <own_documentation>
	                    <title>Adding Your Own Documentation</title>
	                    <file>AddingYourOwnDocumentation.html</file>
	                </own_documentation>
	                <example_styling>
	                    <title>Example Markup Styling</title>
	                    <file>ExampleDocumentationMarkup.html</file>
	                </example_styling>
	            </pages>	            	            
	        </Meanbee_BundledDocs>
	    </docs>	
	</config>

* The `Meanbee_BundledDocs` section should match your extension folder structure as it's used to locate your `docs/` folder.
* All children of the `<pages />` tag should be unique.
* The `<file />` tag is the filename of the documentation item in your `docs/` folder.

If all goes well, you should see something like:

###Â Documentation Style Guide

All documentation should open with a `<h1>` and all body text should be within `<p>` tags.  You can check out the `ExampleDocumentationMarkup.html` in the, wait for it, extension documentation section.
